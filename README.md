# MO2 Razer Macro Builder

Purpose of this project is to allow the creation of razer macros based off a word list

* At the moment all words are lower case
* Scripts can be split up into multiple files
* Uses a word list of 3 char words

Different resolutions may cause issues with the mouse movement. At the moment, it's setup for `2560x1440`

This was just a quickly thrown together script as a POC. Don't blame me if you get banned.
